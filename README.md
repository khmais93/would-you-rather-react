# Would you rather

This app is the final project for the Udacity React-Redux course, which is part of the React Nanodegree program.

It's a web application that allows users to play the game "Would You Rather?" The game is played like this: a user is asked, "Would you like [option A] or [option B]?" It is against the rules to answer "neither" or "both."

Users, which are some Pokemons, can ask and answer questions, check which questions they have or have not answered, see how other Pokemons voted, and see how they rank on the leaderboard with this app.

On the home page, after logging in, the Pokemon can toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls. In all categories, the polls are organized from most recently created to least recently created.

When a Pokemon votes in a poll, all of the information from the poll that was answered is presented. On the poll details page, the Pokemon's response is recorded and clearly apparent. Pokemons are only allowed to vote once per question and cannot change their answers once they have voted. The polling question appears in the "Answered" column when the user returns to the main page.
